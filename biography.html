   <h3>Biography</h3>
   <!--this is a comment-->
   <p> Welcome to my webpage! My name is Kyle Parker. I am currently studying full stack development at San Diego Global Knowledge University and I hope <b>one day</b> to work in the field of software development </p>

   <p><i>but your probably wondering how I got here...</i></p>

   <p> It all begins in the year <sup>1993</sup>, the year I was born. I was born in Sacramento, California but I grew up in the suburbs outside of the city. From a young age I had an interest in computer related things. I remember playing online videogames, burning CDS for friends, and talking to people in AOL Instant Messenger Chatrooms <mark>AIM</mark> before I was in middle school. My first experience with programmming <del>was in the year 2274</del> was in high school (Python). However I didn't get anywhere with it and gave it up pretty quickly. It wasn't until college that I tried programming again<sub>There I took 2 courses in the Computer Science department and did some programming in C++</sub><ins>but all of the programming I did was really simple.</ins></p>

   <p> Now I will finish with a more straightforward, chronological biography.</p>
       
    
   <p>I grew up outside of Sacramento. When I turned 18 I joined the Air Force as an MP. I deployed once and left at the end of my enlistment. I returned home and went to college for 5 years, changing my major multiple times and not really settling on anything. When my GI Bill was used up, I left because I didn't want to take any loans when I want't sure what I wanted to study. And for the last two years I have worked as a delivery driver.</p>
